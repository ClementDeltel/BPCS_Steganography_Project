## BPCS-Stegnography

### Bit-Plane Complexity Segmentation Steganography

Abstract:

Bit Plane Complexity Segmentation (BPCS) steganography is a technique to hide data inside an image file. Traditional techniques  have limited  information hiding capacity. This paper describes, analyzes and implements a steganographic technique that embeds a payload into a lossy format JPEG using BPCS technique. This technique takes advantage of the human eye limitation where a human cannot identify any information in a very complicated binary pattern. The main principle of BPCS technique is that the bit planes of the binary image are divided into the informative region and the noise-like region. The noise-like regions in the bit planes of the vessel image can then be replaced with secret data without affecting the image quality. The secret data is hidden into noise-like region of the cover or vessel image without any distortion to the vessel image.
