NEHIM, Yemen Desperate to break through enemy lines, the Saudi-backed forces fighting in Yemen are sending untrained soldiers to clear minefields, 
sometimes using only their bayonets.

I removed two and the third one exploded, said Sultan Hamad, a 39-year-old Yemeni soldier who lost a leg clearing mines on the front line near 
Marib, an ancient city in central Yemen. He was among more than a half dozen soldiers waiting at a clinic in Marib to be fitted for prosthetic 
limbs.

Nearly four years after Saudi Arabia plunged into Yemen s civil war, Saudi and Yemeni commanders say that hundreds of thousands of unmarked 
land mines planted by their opponents, the Houthis, have emerged as perhaps their most formidable defense.

The hidden explosives, the commanders say, have helped keep the conflict close to a standstill despite the superior air power and other resources 
of the Saudi-led coalition.

The mines have also killed as many as 920 civilians and wounded thousands, according to mine removal experts. Rights groups and other monitors say 
the minefields will leave Yemen riddled with buried explosives that could kill or maim unsuspecting civilians for decades before the devices can 
all be removed, as they have in Afghanistan, Colombia and Cambodia.

The scale of the problem is exceptionally large, and the impact is horrendous, said Loren Persi Vicentic of Landmine Monitor, an independent 
nonprofit group. Most of the casualties we see reported are civilians.

A Western mine-removal company hired by the Saudis estimates that the Houthis have laid more than a million mines, more than one for every 30 
Yemenis and a concentration as high as that in any other country since World War II.

Crouching behind a low stone wall over the edge of a ridge in the district of Nehim on a recent overcast afternoon, Brig. Gen. Mohsen al-Khabi 
could almost make out the distant lights of Sanaa, the Houthi-controlled capital, just 23 miles away.

But those 23 miles might as well be 500, he said. The Houthis had planted so many land mines among the winding roads and scattered settlements 
of the valley, the advance of his Yemeni forces had all but ground to halt, stuck for three years in virtually the same position.
